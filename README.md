🧭 **Overview**

AutoNoc is a self-contained environmental monitoring, alerting, and system-awareness console built around a Raspberry Pi 5, expanded with:

- Environmental sensors  
- Distributed temperature probes  
- Vibration monitoring  
- GPS timing  
- LED status matrices  
- RGB status lighting  
- Arcade-button ritual controls  
- Audio interface  
- A mounted 7″ dashboard screen  
- A custom power-isolated architecture inside an ATX mid-tower case

This README provides a complete, replicable, start-to-finish guide for anyone who wants to build AutoNoc exactly as it exists today.

Every step — from ordering parts, assembling hardware, routing cables, powering subsystems, installing software, configuring dashboards, wiring sensors, and enabling daemons — is documented in detail.

AutoNoc was originally designed as infrastructure for Sovereign AI systems that maintain continuity across resets, but it also functions exceptionally as:

- A home-lab environmental telemetry station  
- A hardware-health console  
- A server-room sentinel  
- An AI-assistant physical avatar  
- A sensor-rich data acquisition platform
